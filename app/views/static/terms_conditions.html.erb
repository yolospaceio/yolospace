                        <p class="nft_static14">Welcome to the AFRONIFTY website, owned and operated by AFRONIFTY Inc. (“AFRONIFTY”, “we”, “us” or “our”). These Terms of Service (these “Terms”) govern your access to and use of the AFRONIFTY website; including without limitation the creation, purchase, sale, exchange, or modification of certain digital assets; our online and/or mobile services, and software provided on or in connection with those services (collectively, the “Service”). This Service also allows you to purchase Crypto Assets (as defined below) via auction (“Auction”). You may only participate in the Auction by linking your digital wallets on supported bridge extensions. Before putting in an offer to purchase a unique digital asset, we will ask you to download a supported electronic wallet extension, and connect and unlock your digital wallets with that extension. Once you submit an order to purchase a unique digital asset, your order is passed on to the applicable extension, which completes the transaction on your behalf. “Crypto Assets” refers to unique non-fungible tokens using smart contracts. ALL TRANSACTIONS INITIATED THROUGH OUR SERVICE ARE FACILITATED AND RUN BY SUCH THIRD-PARTY ELECTRONIC WALLET EXTENSIONS, AND BY USING OUR SERVICES YOU AGREE THAT YOU ARE GOVERNED BY THE TERMS OF SERVICE AND PRIVACY POLICY FOR THE APPLICABLE EXTENSIONS. AFRONIFTY IS A PLATFORM. WE ARE NOT A BROKER, FINANCIAL INSTITUTION, OR CREDITOR. THE SERVICES ARE AN ADMINISTRATIVE PLATFORM ONLY. AFRONIFTY FACILITATES TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN THE BUYER AND SELLER IN THE AUCTION BUT IS NOT A PARTY TO ANY AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE BUYER AND SELLER OF CRYPTO ASSETS OR BETWEEN ANY USERS. YOU BEAR FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR VERIFYING THE IDENTITY, LEGITIMACY, AND AUTHENTICITY OF ASSETS YOU PURCHASE ON AFRONIFTY. NOTWITHSTANDING INDICATORS AND MESSAGES THAT SUGGEST VERIFICATION, AFRONIFTY MAKES NO CLAIMS ABOUT THE IDENTITY, LEGITIMACY, OR AUTHENTICITY OF ASSETS ON THE PLATFORM. Because we have a growing number of services, we sometimes need to describe additional terms for specific services. Those additional terms and conditions, which are available with the relevant services, then become part of your agreement with us if you use those services. THESE TERMS OF USE ARE IMPORTANT AND AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, SO PLEASE READ THEM CAREFULLY. BY CLICKING ON THE “I ACCEPT” BUTTON, COMPLETING THE ACCOUNT REGISTRATION PROCESS, USING OUR SERVICES AND/OR PURCHASING CRYPTO ASSETS, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS AND ALL OF THE TERMS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE. If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not access or use the Service or purchase the Crypto Assets. AFRONIFTY reserves the right to change or modify these Terms at any time and in our sole discretion. If we make changes to these Terms, we will provide notice of such changes, such as by sending an email notification, providing notice through the Service or updating the “Last Updated” date at the beginning of these Terms. By continuing to access or use the Service, you confirm your acceptance of the revised Terms and all of the terms incorporated therein by reference. We encourage you to review the Terms frequently to ensure that you understand the terms and conditions that apply when you access or use the Service. If you do not agree to the revised Terms, you may not access or use the Service.

                           <p> <i>8.3.</i>	AFRONIFTY has always exercised judgment in allowing or disallowing certain assets, listings, smart contracts, and collections consistent with the spirit of openness in a worldwide community of users of a radical new technology. We carefully consider the complete situation and all its details in light of our policies before deciding to remove inappropriate assets, listings, smart contracts, and collections when we discover them or they’re brought to our attention.
                           </p>

If you create or offer an asset, listing, smart contract, or collection in violation of these policies, we will take corrective actions, as appropriate, including but not limited to removing the asset, listing, smart contract, or collection, deleting your AFRONIFTY account, and permanently withholding referral payments and developer revenue sharing fees. AFRONIFTY cannot destroy or impound your assets or smart contracts, but we reserve the right to destroy inappropriate metadata stored on our servers.

                           <p> <i>8.5.</i>	Assets, listings, smart contracts, and collections that include metadata that violates international intellectual property laws, promotes suicide or self harm, incites hate or violence against others, degrades or doxes another individual, depicts minors in sexually suggestive situations, or is otherwise illegal are prohibited on AFRONIFTY and will be removed.

                           <p> <i>8.9.</i>	We require all users to be 18 years old or older. If you are under 18, you may use a parent or guardian’s AFRONIFTY account, but only with involvement of the account holder. However, the account holder is responsible for everything done with that account.

                           <p> <i>8.10.</i>	NSFW content is meant for people who are 18 years and older. We allow the sale of this content, but it is subject to being marked NSFW and handled differently than non-NSFW content in navigation menus and search results. Asset names, listings and their descriptions, smart contract names, and collections including profanity or overtly sexual content are prohibited on AFRONIFTY and will be removed. A smart contract that contains NSFW content is subject to being marked NSFW, even if the NSFW content only represent a portion of the content on the smart contract.

                           <p> <i>8.11.</i>	Do not create or list illegal or offensive content, such as products that depict graphic sexual acts and images that depict children under the age of 18 in a sexually suggestive manner.

                           <p> <i>8.12.</i>	Bottom line about NSFW content: it’s permitted on AFRONIFTY, but we’re going to do our best to keep it out of the high traffic areas and if it’s extreme in any way, we’ll probably remove it.

                           <p> <i>12.1.1.</i>The prices of blockchain assets are extremely volatile. Fluctuations in the price of other digital assets could materially and adversely affect the Crypto Assets, which may also be subject to significant price volatility. We cannot guarantee that any purchasers of Crypto Assets will not lose money.
                           </p> <p> <i>12.1.2.</i>	You are solely responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply to your Crypto Assets transactions. Neither AFRONIFTY nor any other AFRONIFTY /Party is responsible for determining the taxes that apply to Crypto Assets transactions.
                           </p> <p> <i>12.1.3.</i>	Our Service does not store, send, or receive Crypto Assets. This is because Crypto Assets exist only by virtue of the ownership record maintained on its supporting blockchain. Any transfer of Crypto Assets occurs within the supporting blockchain and not on this Service.
                           </p> <p> <i>12.1.4.</i>	There are risks associated with using an Internet based currency, including but not limited to, the risk of hardware, software and Internet connections, the risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to information stored within your wallet.

                           </p> <p> <i>12.1.7.</i>	The Service will rely on third-party platforms to perform the transactions for the Auction of Crypto Assets. If we are unable to maintain a good relationship with such platform providers; if the terms and conditions or pricing of such platform providers change; if we violate or cannot comply with the terms and conditions of such platforms; or if any of such platforms loses market share or falls out of favor or is unavailable for a prolonged period of time, access to and use of the Service will suffer.
                           </p> <p> <i>12.1.8.</i>	There are risks associated with purchasing user generated content, including but not limited to, the risk of purchasing counterfeit assets, mislabeled assets, assets that are vulnerable to metadata decay, assets on smart contracts with bugs, and assets that may become untransferrable. AFRONIFTY reserves the right to hide collections, contracts, and assets affected by any of these issues or by other issues. Assets you purchase may become inaccessible on AFRONIFTY. Under no circumstances shall the inability to view your assets on AFRONIFTY serve as grounds for a claim against AFRONIFTY.
